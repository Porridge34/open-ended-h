    <h1><strong>Poverty</strong></h1>
    <p>The definition of <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poverty">poverty</a> is the state of being extremely poor. Many people on the earth experience poverty. In fact, <a href = "https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview">~10% of people</a> right now are living with less than 1.90USD a day, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa. But that's only the people living off of less than 1.90$ a day. I think poverty means being unable to function as well in society because of the lack of the ability to buy necessary things. This includes water, food, and shelter. Poverty would depend on the surroundings of the person. A person living in a poorer country would likely have a lower cost of living compared to someone living in the United States. What is considered too low to live off of in America would likely be more than enough in a different country. Another thing is that there are different levels of poverty. There's extreme poverty where the person cannot afford to buy the basic necesities, and poverty where the person must choose between buying food and utilities like electricity. The first form of poverty is not as common in developed places such as the United States. I think that it's pretty luck I was born in such a developed country.</p>
